# Day 3
## Artificial Intelligence (AI)
* AI refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines programmed to think, reason, and learn like humans.
* AI systems use algorithms and data to recognize patterns, make decisions, and improve performance.
* Core concepts of AI include Machine Learning, Neural Networks, Deep Learning, etc.
* Alan Turing, a British mathematician and computer scientist, was one of the early pioneers in Artificial Intelligence.
* In 1950, he created the Turing test to assess a machine's ability to emulate human intelligence.

## Machine Learning (ML)
* ML is a subdomain of AI that focuses on developing systems that learn or improve performance based on input data.
* It is a data-driven technology. Machines learn from past data and improve performance.
* ML algorithms analyze data, recognize patterns, and make predictions based on past information.
* The quality and quantity of input data impact the performance of the ML models.
* Types of Machine Learning approaches:
  1. Supervised Learning
  2. Unsupervised Learning

## Supervised Learning
* It is a fundamental approach in machine learning where models are trained using labeled datasets.
* The model learns by finding patterns in the data to map inputs to the correct outputs.
* This technique is used to predict outcomes based on input features.
* Applications of Supervised Learning include spam detection, image classification, etc.
* Types of Supervised Learning:
  1. Classification: The model learns to categorize data points based on labeled examples provided during training.
  2. Regression: The model learns from labeled data to predict a target value within a continuous range instead of classifying it into specific categories.

 ## Unsupervised Learning
 * It is a fundamental approach in machine learning where models are trained using unlabeled datasets.
 * Unsupervised learning focuses on identifying hidden patterns and structures in data without using labeled outputs.
 * This method relies on the inherent structure of the input data.
 * The model fundamentally learns the structure of the data independently.
 * Types of Unsupervised Learning:
   1. Clustering: The algorithm detects patterns in data to create clusters based on their characteristics.
   2. Association: The algorithm detects relationships, associations, and patterns among variables in large datasets.

## Python 
* Python is a high-level object-oriented programming language.
* Created by Guido van Rossum.
* Python's syntax is clear and straightforward, making it beginner-friendly and easy to use.
* Python provides a collection of libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn for data science.

## Data Science Life Cycle
* It is a structured process for working on data science projects, ensuring that the data is collected, analyzed, and transformed into actionable insights.
* It helps to convert large quantities of unstructured records or data into significant insights.
* This methodology can assist in predictions such as the range of surveys, elections, etc.

* The stages of the data science life cycle include:
  1. Business understanding: Defining the problem or objectives and goals of the project.
  2. Preparation of data: Gather relevant data and clean the data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, correcting errors,
     and formatting it for analysis. 
  3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualization tools are used to understand patterns, relationships, etc within the data.
  4. Modeling the data: Machine learning algorithms are applied to train models on prepared data.
  5. Evaluating the model: The model is examined and evaluated using assessment metrics like accuracy, precision, etc.
