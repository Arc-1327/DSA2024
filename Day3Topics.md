## Artificial Intelligence (AI)
* AI refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think, reason, and learn like humans.
* AI systems use algorithms and data to recognize patterns, make decisions, and improve performance.
* Core concepts of AI include Machine Learning, Neural Networks, Deep Learning, etc.
* Alan Turing, a British mathematician and computer scientist, was one of the early pioneers in Artificial Intelligence.
* In 1950, he created the Turing test to assess a machine's ability to emulate human intelligence.
