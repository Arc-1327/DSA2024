## Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
* The Software Development Life Cycle is a structured process to design, develop, and test software.
* It provides a methodology that outlines the entire software development procedure step-by-step. 
* The primary goal of the SDLC model is to deliver maintainable software that meets the user's requirements.



* Stages of the Software Development Life Cycle :
  - Stage 1: Planning and requirement analysis
    - This stage defines the project's purpose, scope, and requirements.
  - Stage 2: Requirement Gathering
    - In this stage, all the requirements for the target software are collected and analyzed.
    - This process utilizes the Software Requirements Specification (SRS), which is a document that outlines everything that needs to be defined and created 
      throughout the entire project cycle.
