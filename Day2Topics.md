## Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
* The Software Development Life Cycle is a structured process to design, develop, and test software.
* It provides a methodology that outlines the entire software development procedure step-by-step. 
* The primary goal of the SDLC model is to deliver maintainable software that meets the user's requirements.

* Stages of the Software Development Life Cycle :
  1. Stage 1- Planning and requirement analysis:
     - This stage defines the project's purpose, scope, and requirements.
  2. Stage 2- Requirement Gathering:
     - In this stage, all the requirements for the target software are collected and analyzed.
     - This process utilizes the Software Requirements Specification (SRS), which is a document that outlines everything that needs to be defined and created 
       throughout the entire project cycle.
  3. Stage 3- Architecture and Design:
     - This stage involves developing a detailed plan for the structure and components of the target software.
  4. Stage 4- Development:
     - At this stage, a functional solution is developed based on the user requirements.
  5. Stage 5- Testing and Integration:
     - Once the product is developed, the software undergoes testing for bugs, security issues, and usability.
     - This process ensures that the software meets the user's requirements.
  6. Stage 6- Deployment:
     - After detailed testing, the software is released to the end users.
  7. Stage 7- Maintenance:
     - Software updates, bug fixes, and enhancements based on user feedback are performed to maintain functionality.

## Agile Methodology
* The Agile Methodology is a flexible and collaborative approach to project management and software development.
* This methodology is iterative, allowing product development in small, manageable sections called Sprints.
* A sprint usually lasts 1 - 2 weeks.
* Each Sprint produces a functioning software that can be reviewed and improved.
* After each sprint, teams evaluate their processes and identify areas for improvement.
* The Agile methodology remains adaptive to changes throughout the development process.
* Popular Agile Frameworks are SCRUM, Kanban, DSDM, etc.

## JIRA Software
* JIRA is a software development tool used for project management, issue tracking, and collaboration.
* Primarily used by software development teams to plan, track, and manage agile projects.
* It supports multiple methodologies like SCRUM, Kanban, and custom workflows.

* JIRA follows a series of steps to manage and track projects, tasks, and issues.
* The steps involved are:
  1. Create an Issue - Involves adding tasks or stories to track work.
  2. Assign the Issue to a team member and add it to a Backlog.
  3. Move Issues from the Backlog to an active Sprint for development.
  4. Update the status of the Issue based on the progress.
  5. Monitor and track progress using dashboards and reports.
  6. Test the Issue and mark it as Done once it's completed.
* JIRA also offers plug-ins, which are software tools that users can install to enhance JIRA's functionality.
* An example of a JIRA plug-in is Zephyr Scale.
