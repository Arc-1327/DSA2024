## Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
* The Software Development Life Cycle is a structured process to design, develop, and test software.
* It provides a methodology that outlines the entire software development procedure step-by-step. 
* The primary goal of the SDLC model is to deliver maintainable software that meets the user's requirements.

* Stages of the Software Development Life Cycle :
  - Stage 1- Planning and requirement analysis:
    - This stage defines the project's purpose, scope, and requirements.
  - Stage 2- Requirement Gathering:
    - In this stage, all the requirements for the target software are collected and analyzed.
    - This process utilizes the Software Requirements Specification (SRS), which is a document that outlines everything that needs to be defined and created 
      throughout the entire project cycle.
  - Stage 3- Architecture and Design:
    - This stage involves developing a detailed plan for the structure and components of the target software.
  - Stage 4- Development:
    - At this stage, a functional solution is developed based on the user requirements.
  - Stage 5- Testing and Integration:
    - Once the product is developed, the software undergoes testing for bugs, security issues, and usability.
    - This process ensures that the software meets the user's requirements.
  - Stage 6- Deployment:
    - After detailed testing, the software is released to the end users.
  - Stage 7- Maintenance:
    - Software updates, bug fixes, and enhancements based on user feedback are performed to maintain functionality.
